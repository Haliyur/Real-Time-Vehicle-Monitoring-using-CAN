# Real-Time-Vehicle-Monitoring-using-CAN
This project implements a real-time vehicle monitoring system using the Controller Area Network (CAN) protocol.

It enables efficient communication between multiple Electronic Control Units (ECUs) such as engine control, temperature sensors, and dashboard display units â€” all without a central host computer.

The system continuously monitors key vehicle parameters (e.g., speed, fuel level, temperature, and fault codes) and transmits them via CAN for centralized data display and analysis.
